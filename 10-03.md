# 10.03 - Exploring Incumbency and the "Time for Change" Model
## Introduction
Last week, I build a weighted ensemble model that used polling averages weighted by pollster quality and the economic indicator of Q2 GDP growth to predict incumbent/challenger vote shares for the 2020 presidential election. Through this exploration, I discovered that, while my model was pretty good in terms of predicting the 2016 election vote shares using "leave-one-out" validation, it predicted Biden winning the popular vote with nearly a 30 point margin of victory (which seems quite unrealistic in the context of modern presidential election results). This week, I test my "best" model from last week against several variations of the ["Time for Change" model developed by Alan Abramowitz] (https://pollyvote.com/en/components/models/retrospective/fundamentals-plus-models/time-for-change-model/). **I ultimately found that the "Time for Change" models I built are more statistically robust than the model that only used polling data and Q2 GDP growth, although the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic led the "Time for Change" model that eschewed an economic indicator to make what seems to be the most feasible prediction.**
