# 09.19 - Building Modeling the 2020 Election with Polling Data
## Introduction
Last week, investigation into several economic predictor variables illuminated that there is a great deal of variation in the ability of such indicators to predict the outcomes of presidential elections. This week, I'm going to be building off of my work last week by beginning to include polling data in my models. First, I'll be exploring the quality of pollsters and polls from 2016 and 2020 and presenting my findings visually. Then, I'll create several simple ensemble models that combine linear regressions using the economic indicator of Q2 GDP growth to predict PV share with aggregated polling data from 2016, and I'll  use the "best" of these models to make a 2020 election prediction. **Ultimately, I find that my models do a fairly good job of predicting the 2016 election using leave-one-out validation, especially when aggregated polling data is weighted based on pollster quality. However, when it comes to predicting the 2020 election, it seems as though the relatively unprecedented economic conditions that exist as a result of COVID-19 may have skewed my predictions in an unrealistic way.** 

# What does pollster quality look like?
This week, we discussed the range of quality in professional surveys/polls that result from a number of substantive characteristics (survey mode, sample size, historical error). Data journalism outlet [FiveThirtyEight assigns "grades"](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/) to all major polling firms based on these characteristics. To start, let's take a look at the overall distribution of pollster firm grades:

# Model 1 - Average Polling + Q2 GDP
Investigation into the Q2 GDP model last week found that is is a fairly good indicator variable when it comes to predicting the popular vote share of presidential elections (it has a statistically significant p-value and relatively high R-squared value). To start, I created an ensemble model that combined a linear regression predicting popular vote share from Q2 GDP growth and unweighted 2016 polling averages to predict the popular vote share for both the incumbent and challenger in the 2016 election using leave-one-out validation.
