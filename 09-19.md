# 09.19 - The Economy: National vs. Local Models
## Introduction
In August, a Pew Research Center poll found that [the economy was the top issue for voters in the upcoming 2020 election](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/important-issues-in-the-2020-election/). Economic variables have long been used in political forcasting to predict the outcomes of elections, and in this post I'll be examining economic & presidential election data to examine the following question: are models that use national economic data better at predicting the outcome of national elections than models that use state or local economic data? Further, is unemployment a good predictor comapred to another economic variable such as GDP growth? **Using state and national popular vote and GDP/unemployment data, I created three models using national GDP growth, national unemployment rate, and state unemployment rates as predictor variables and ultimately find that the models using national and state unemployment rates to predict incumbent party popular vote share show statistically insignificant relationships between the predictor and outcome variables.**

## Model 1 - Q2 GDP Growth
To start, I replicated the fairly standard Q2 GDP growth model that we've been spending a lot of time talking about in class. While Q2 GDP growth is an indirect way to measure the impact of economic conditions in the United States, it's a fairly common predictor variable [in many professional election models](https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president/how-this-works), and the correlation between Q2 GDP growth and incumbent party popular vote share is fairly high at .57. Below, see a plot of the regression line from a regression where Q2 GDP growth is the predictor variable and incumbent party popular vote share is the outcome.

 A closer look at some of the model's other outputs shows that the Q2 GDP growth variable has a statistically significant p-value of .0133 and an adjusted R-squared value of .284, indicating that the model can predict around 28% of the variation in the outcome variable. A This isn't great, but it isn't too bad for a very simple model that uses only one variable to predict an outcome that is driven by a far more complicated reality. **Ultimately, this model predicts that Donald Trump will recieve 21.3% of the popular vote in the 2020 election.**

## Model 2 - Q2 National Unemployment
Next, I created a new model using a variable that is frequently discussed in ![test](q2_gdp_pvshare.jpeg)
