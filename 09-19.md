# 09.19 - The Economy: National vs. Local Models
## Introduction
In August, a Pew Research Center poll found that [the economy was the top issue for voters in the upcoming 2020 election](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/important-issues-in-the-2020-election/). Economic variables have long been used in political forcasting to predict the outcomes of elections, and in this post I'll be examining economic & presidential election data to examine the following question: are models that use national economic data better at predicting the outcome of national elections than models that use state or local economic data? Further, is unemployment a good predictor comapred to another economic variable such as GDP growth? **Using state and national popular vote and GDP/unemployment data, I created three models using national GDP growth, national unemployment rate, and state unemployment rates as predictor variables and ultimately find that the models using national and state unemployment rates to predict incumbent party popular vote share show statistically insignificant relationships between the predictor and outcome variables.**

## Model 1
To start, I replicated the fairly standard Q2 GDP growth model that we've been spending a lot of time talking about in class. While Q2 GDP growth is an indirect way to measure the impact of economic conditions in the United States, it's a fairly common predictor variable [in many professional election models] (https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president/how-this-works), and the correlation between Q2 GDP growth and incumbent party popular vote share is fairly high at .57.
