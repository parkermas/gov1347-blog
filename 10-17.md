# Introduction
Last week, I built probabilistic models that used binomial logistic regression to predict a distribution of statewide election results based off of historical results and random draws that represent possible rates of voter turnout. However, one flaw of this model is that it ultimately used only one value to represent the turnout rate of the voting eligible population (VEP), while the actual range of possibilities for the turnout rate (nationally or for any given state) could be represented by a range of possible values bounded by a maximum and minimum informed by historical data and recent trends. Thus, I decided to explore historical trends in presidential election turnout by state and expanded upon my models from last week to more accurately reflect expected 2020 turnout rates for the presidential election.
