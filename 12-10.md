# Introduction

Over the course of the last few months, I have been focusing on building models to forecast the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. This week, however, I'll be using data to explore the validity of a salient media narrative surrounding the 2020 election; specifically, the idea that partisan polarization reached an all time high during the 2020 presidential election. In the weeks since the election, a variety of different [media outlets](https://news.wttw.com/2020/11/10/political-divide-2020-election-reaffirms-polarization-us), [magazines](https://time.com/5907318/polarization-2020-election/), and [quantitatively-oriented think tanks](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/06/2020-election-reveals-two-broad-voting-coalitions-fundamentally-at-odds/) have written about the issue of increasing partisan polarization in the United States as shown through the results of said election. One shocking statistic from a [Pew Research Center poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/13/america-is-exceptional-in-the-nature-of-its-political-divide/) shows that 89% of Trump supporters said they would be very concerned about the lasting damage a Biden presidency would cause to the United States, while 90% of Biden supporters similarly said they would be concered about the lasting damage a second Trump term would cause to the US.

It's clear there is substantial evidence regarding the rise of partisan polarization in the United States, but is it true that the 2020 election was one of the most polarizing ever? To investigate, I'll be taking a look at historical state and county level presidential election results to see if (1) a pattern of increasing partisan polarization is present in county-level election returns, and (2) if the 2020 election saw an unprecedented increase in partisan polarization relative to previous elections in modern US political history. These questions are important because of the potential implications for electoral politics, as political parties and candidates have a limited number of time/resources and thus need to figure out where to best spend them. If the US is becoming more polarized along partisan lines, that means that there are probably less places where candidates can be competitive, especially with an electoral system such as the electoral college. Ultimately, I find that 2020 marks a continuation of a longstanding pattern of increasing partisan polarization in presidential elections, but that 2020 does not necessarily seem to be the most polarizing election for both Democrats and Republicans. 

# State-Level Trends

To start, I wanted to explore the number of battleground states in presidential elections going all the way back to 1948. For the purposes of this visualization, I considered all states where the margin of victory was less than 5 percentage points to be battleground states. Theoretically, a declining number of battleground states could signal increasing polarization of a state's electorate, with one party eventually recieving enough of the vote year after year that the other party is increasingly less able to compete in said state. Interestingly, the average number of battleground states from 1948-2020 was 10.1, and there were 8 battleground states in 2020.
